At present, all of the remaining Maintenance Meks in Fontaine are totally unsupervised, and the \"Platinum Collection\" batch are no exception – they have all been lost to the water. Disappearing completely off the radar, they have turned out to be the most unique and expensive \"fishes\" in Fontaine.
