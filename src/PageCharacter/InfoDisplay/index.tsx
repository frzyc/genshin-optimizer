      <Typography variant="h4">Character Inventory</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>All the characters that you've added to Genshin Optimizer are in this screen. This inventory screen allow you to Add/edit/delete characters, as well as see an overview of each character from each card.</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>To Edit specific details of a character, click on its corresponding card, or click on the <SqBadge color="info"><FontAwesomeIcon icon={faEdit} /> Edit Stats</SqBadge> Button</Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5">Filtering and sorting</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>You can also filter the characters by Elemental or Weapons, and sort the characters by Level/Rarity/Name.</Typography>
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} lg={6} xl={7} >
      <Typography variant="h4">Character Editor</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>This is the main character editor. There is a lot to unpack here, so each sections are labeled. </Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5">1. Character & level template selector</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>You can change the character to edit here. The Level template changes the default base stats that are populated in the editor for the character. Currently, GO only offers milestone templates, so the stats will need to be manually adjusted for non-milestone levels.</Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5">2. Navigation tabs</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>The tabs here navigate to different views of the character editor. Currently the <i>Character</i> view is enabled. The <i>Artifacts</i> and <i>Talents</i> view will be elaborated in their dedicated section below.</Typography>
      <Typography variant="h5">3. Party Infusion, Hit Mode & Reaction Mode</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>If a character's autos can be infused with an element from their talents(e.g. <i>Chongyun's Spirit Blade: Chonghua's Layered Frost</i>), this will need to be manually enabled here.</Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>For the DMG numbers shown in GO, the <b>Hit Mode</b> determines how they are calculated: </Typography>
      <Typography component="div">
        <ul>
          <li><b>Avg. DMG:</b> The damage is averaged over CRIT Rate & CRIT DMG.</li>
          <li><b>Non Crit DMG:</b> The damage of a non-crit hit. CRIT Rate & CRIT DMG are not part of the calculations.</li>
          <li><b>Crit Hit DMG:</b> The damage of a  crit hit. CRIT Rate is ignored. Only CRIT DMG is part of the calculations.</li>
        </ul>
      </Typography>
      <Typography gutterBottom>A character's damage changes drastically when they do an amplifing reaction, like <ColorText color="vaporize">Vaporize</ColorText> or <ColorText color="melt">Melt</ColorText>. You can enable the <b>Reaction Mode</b> from this toggle.</Typography>

      <Typography variant="h6">4.2 Calculation details</Typography>

      <Typography variant="h5">5. Character Overview</Typography>

      <Typography variant="h5">7. Stats Editor</Typography>
