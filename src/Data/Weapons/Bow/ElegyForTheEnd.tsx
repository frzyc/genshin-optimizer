  passiveDescription: stats => <span>A part of the "Millennial Movement" that wanders amidst the winds. Increases Elemental Mastery by {refinementEM[stats.weapon.refineIndex]}. When the Elemental Skills or Elemental Bursts of the character wielding this weapon hit opponents, that character gains a <b>Sigil of Remembrance</b>. This effect can be triggered once every 0.2s and can be triggered even if said character is not on the field. When you possess 4 Sigils of Remembrance, all of them will be consumed and all nearby party members will obtain the <b>"Millennial Movement: Farewell Song"</b> effect for 12s. "Millennial Movement: Farewell Song" increases Elemental Mastery by {refinementIncEM[stats.weapon.refineIndex]} and increases ATK by {refinementATK_[stats.weapon.refineIndex]}%. Once this effect is triggered, you will not gain Sigils of Remembrance for 20s. Of the many effects of the "Millennial Movement," buffs of the same type will not stack.</span>,//${refinementVals[stats.weapon.refineIndex]}
