  "intro": "<0>What is Genshin Optimizer?</0><1>Genshin Optimizer (GO) is an open-source fan-made website for the action-RPG gacha game <1><strong>Genshin Impact</strong></1>. It is mainly intended to help players with the complex aspect of the game: Artifact Optimization. Since artifacts are heavily RNG-based elements that directly contribute to how effective your characters are in the game, GO will try to find the best artifacts for your characters based on your current artifact inventory.</1><2>GO can keep track of your artifacts, and allows more ease in filtering/comparing artifacts, it serves as a tool to help user find good artifacts in their inventory to level up, and bad artifacts to use as fodder.</2><3>Since GO can replicate the exact stats of any character, along with calculate all their damage numbers to up 1% accuracy, it can also serve as a Damage calculator, and a tool for theory crafting.</3>",
  "notGO": "<0>What Genshin Optimizer is NOT:</0><1>GO does NOT tell you how to play the game. The information/calculations are intended to be un-opinionated as possible.</1><2>GO does NOT supplement your lack of in-game knowledge, inappropriate configuration of the builder can provide misleading results. Please research your characters, and figure out how you want to use them before configuring them on GO. Think of GO as more of a calculator.</2><3>GO does NOT generally take consideration of Energy Recharge, or team rotations. Please keep those mechanics in mind when you use this tool.</3>",
