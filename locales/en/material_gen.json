The original edition of this text was transcribed on Watatsumi Island and brought back to Narukami Island by a merchant while the former's serpent god yet lived. No one reads this ancient tome nowadays, its role supplanted by all the light novels on the market. This book describes the unique cosmological outlook of the Watatsumi people before they came to adopt aspects of Narukami culture, and a recent resurgence in traditional novel publishing has allowed it to see the light of day once more."

    "description": "A classic rice dish served in large quantities. With the first bite, the crispy outside cracks with delightful crunching sounds. The second bite combines the soft and moist rice with juicy meat in your mouth. Then, the third bite brings in the Padisarah's fragrance... The last bite, however, leaves your heart empty. What a pity it is, that you are too full to continue this wondrous experience. Well then, why not have another serving tomorrow?"

    "description": "A grilled fish dish with a faint floral scent. It is said that Lambad once adventured far and wide in his youth. Everywhere he went, he would taste the grilled fish at local taverns. This dish was not a signature food in Sumeru, and Lambad thought it was a pity, so he invented his own fish roll. According to the gourmets who often dine at his tavern, the tales of his adventures aren't necessarily true, but his fish roll is undoubtedly delicious."

At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.\\nThis is the origin of the phrase \"Chiyo the Tiger-Bite,\" and would be changed over many years to \"Torachiyo.\"\\nBut within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty Narukami Ogosho. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the tengu, or perhaps by the Shuumatsuban — or perhaps by a scion of the Iwakura Clan training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the oni-masked, sword-bearing doll near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.\\nFew among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority. The border between worlds grows fragile, and corruption of this kind is perhaps not merely monodirectional."

When they are young, they are as gold as sunlight. Later in life, however, their colors deepen, and their two 'wings' will be colored with a purple as deep as the night. Rays at this stage of life earned the name \"Formalo\" in those ancient scrolls, which means \"the maw of greed.\""

They look like an unripe fruit on a tree branch, hence the nickname \"True Fruit.\" \\nHowever, there are very few bones in this fish. The meat is fatty and rich, but if it's not handled properly, or you remove its gallbladder too late, the fish's meat will be as sour as unripe fruit. Therefore, \"making this fish delicious\" has become the standard by which all chefs are measured."

These fish are, as their name suggests, so sweet that they are considered \"ideal for dessert.\"\\nDoubtless, owing to various factors, the fish dessert that the fish chefs were hoping to create did not pan out. Because this type of fish is rare and expensive, it is often farmed as an ornamental fish. \\nThere is a large customer base that doesn't want to spend too much Mora on this kind of pufferfish, but nevertheless can't get enough of its bright colors. There are even enterprising businessmen who have managed to reverse this phenomenon, modeling their Zaytun Peaches after these pufferfish. The sales of those are pretty good."

With its immense strength and strongest horns amongst its kind, this fish acts as an \"underwater workhorse.\" They have evolved their protective coloration as a result of long-term activities in the riverbed and the bottom of the lake, along with spending all their days with pervasive river and lake sand as companions."

The color comes from their unique way of survival — their cutis contains a substance similar to bile, which is far more acidic than that of other fish, causing them to be shunned by many underwater creatures.\\nBut when cooked in a special way, the acidity actually adds to the freshness of the fish. As a result, this fish sells very well. At Sumeru's fish markets, you can often see signs that say: \"Do not keep Sunset Cloud Anglers in the same tank as other fish meant for consumption.\""

Due to their hard scales and big size, Axe Marlins are able to handle attacks from other aquatic creatures, waiting until their attacker is exhausted and leaves.\\nTheir strength can also prove challenging for a master fisherman, whose only choice is to treat them as large beasts — to drain their stamina more efficiently and eventually catch them, one must go all out the moment an Axe Marlin bites."
