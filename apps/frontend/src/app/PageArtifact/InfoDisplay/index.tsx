            The <b>number of rolls</b> a substat has is shown to the left of the

            When a 5<StarRoundedIcon {...iconInlineProps} /> have 9(4+5) total
            rolls, with each of the rolls having the highest value, that is
            defined as a 900% RV artifact. However, most of the artifacts are
            not this lucky. The <b>Current RV</b> of an artifact is a percentage
            over that 100% artifact. The <b>Maximum RV</b> is the maximum
            possible RV an artifact can achieve, if the remaining artifact rolls
            from upgrades are the hightest possible value.
