# gi-frontend-gql

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

The intention of this lib is to provide generated types/apis generated from the `apps\gi-backend\src\app\schema_gen.graphql` in the backend and `libs\gi\frontend-gql\src\lib\graphql\operations.graphql` in this lib.

## Generate types

From project root:

```
nx codegen gi-frontend-gql
```

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test gi-frontend-gql` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).
