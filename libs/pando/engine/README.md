## Tags

A tag is a dictionary of tag category (key) and tag value (value) pairs.
We denote a tag category and a tag value by `cat:` and `cat:val`, respectively.
When there is no ambiguity, `val` may be used instead of `cat:val`.
We also define a "combination" of tags `T1` and `T2`, denoted by `T1/T2`, as a tag such that for any tag category `cat:`,

- If `cat:v` ∈ `T2`, then `cat:v` ∈ `T1/T2`,
- If `cat:` ∉ `T2` and `cat:v` ∈ `T1`, then `cat:v` ∈ `T1/T2`, and
- If `cat:` ∉ `T2` and `cat:` ∉ `T1`, then `cat:` ∉ `T1/T2`.

Note the asymmetry between `T1` and `T2`.
As an example, the combination `{ c1:v1 c2:v2 }/{ c2:v3 c3:v4 }` is the tag `{ c1:v1 c2:v3 c3:v4 }`.
In this example, `c1:` and `c3:` exist in only one of the tags, and so their values are used.
For `c2:`, both tags contain different values, and so the value in the right tag is preferred.

### Tag Database Gathering

A calculator `calc` contains an array of tag-node pairs, called Tag Database.
Each entry `{ tag, value }` in the tag database signifies that the computation of `tag` should include `value`.
We denote a tag database entry with `tag <- value`.
If `value` is a reread to `tag2`, we may instead denote the entry with `tag <= tag2`.
Note the different arrow type between the two, as well as the type difference on the right side of the arrow.

With tag database, `calc` can _gather a tag `T`_ via `calc.get(T)`, returning all entries in the tag database with matching tags.
An entry `tag <- value` in the tag database is included in a gathering iff for every `k:v` ∈ `tag`, `v == null` or `k:v` ∈ `T`.
If the value in the included entry is a `node`, its value is computed using tag `T`.
If the value is a `Reread` with tag `T2`, another gather is performed using `T/T2`, and its result is appended to the final result.
As an example, consider `calc.get({ c1:v1 c2:vA })` when the `calc`ulator has the following Tag Database,

```
[
  { c1:v1       } <- node1, // entry 1
  { c1:v2       } <- node2, // entry 2
  { c1:v1 c2:vA } <- node3, // entry 3
  { c1:v1 c2:vB } <- node4, // entry 4
  {       c2:vA } <- node5, // entry 5
  { c1:v1 c2:vA } <= { c2:vB } // entry 6
].
```

In this case, `calc` first selects the matching entries 1, 3, 5, and 6.
As entries 1, 3, and 5 contain nodes, `calc` computes nodes 1, 3, and 5 with tag `{ c1:v1 c2:vA }`.
Next, the the calculator resolves entry 6, by performing a gathering with tag `{ c1:v1 c2:vA }/{ c2:vB } = { c1:v1 c2:vB }`, computing nodes 1 and 4 with tag `{ c1:v1 c2:vB }`.
The calculator then returns the following:

- Value of `node1` computed with tag `{ c1:v1 c2:vA }`,
- Value of `node3` computed with tag `{ c1:v1 c2:vA }`,
- Value of `node5` computed with tag `{ c1:v1 c2:vA }`,
- Value of `node1` computed with tag `{ c1:v1 c2:vB }`, and
- Value of `node4` computed with tag `{ c1:v1 c2:vB }`.

Note that `node1` is computed twice, each with different tags, due to `reread` operation.

## Node Operations

This section outlines all operations supported by Pando.
Operations are separated into three types, arithmetic, branching, and tag-related.

### Arithmetic Operations

- `constant(c)`: values of a constant `c` (converting it to a `Node`),
  - This is normally unneeded as most functions permit both `Node` and constants,
- `sum(x1, x2, ...) := x1 + x2 + ...`,
- `prod(x1, x2, ...) := x1 * x2 * ...`,
- `min(x1, x2, ...) := Math.min(x1, x2, ...)`,
- `max(x1, x2, ...) := Math.max(x1, x2, ...)`,
- `sumfrac(x1, x2) := x1 / (x1 + x2)`,
- `subscript(index, array) := array[index]`.
  `array` can be either array of strings or of numbers,
- `custom(op, x1, x2, ...)` is for custom node for non-standard computations,
  - See [Calculator Customization Section](#customize) on how to add support for custom operations.

### Branching Operations

Most branching functions are of the form `cmp<<CMP>>(x1, x2, pass, fail)` where a comparator CMP (e.g., `Eq`) is used to compare `x1` and `x2`.
If the comparison yields true (e.g., `x1 == x2` for `cmpEq`), then `pass` branch is chosen.
Otherwise, `fail` branch is chosen.
Unchosen branch is not evaluated.
`fail` can be omitted if it is 0.
Supported comparators include

- `Eq` (`x1 == x2`) and `NE` (`x1 != x2`),
- `GE` (`x1 >= x2`) and `GT` (`x1 > x2`), and
- `LE` (`x1 <= x2`) and `LT` (`x1 < x2`).

Another branching function is `lookup(key, table, defaultV) := table[key] ?? defaultV`.
There are two main distinctions between `subscript` and `lookup`:

- `lookup` indices are strings while `subscript` indices are numbers, and
- `lookup` `table` may contain complex nodes while `subscript` `array` can contain only constants.

Nodes other than `table[key]` are not evaluated.
When both `lookup` and `subscript` are applicable, prefer `subscript` for performance reason.

### Tag-Related Operations

By default, all arithmetic and branching operations preserve the tags, e.g., calculating `sum(x1, x2)` with a tag `T`, the calculation of `x1` and `x2` also use the same tag `T`.
When computing with a current tag `Tcur`

- `tagVal(cat)` reads the value of `Tcur` at category `cat`, or `""` if `cat:` ∉ `Tcur`,
- `tag(v, tag)` calculates `v` using `Tcur/tag`,
- `dynTag(v, tag)` calculates `v` using `Tcur/tag`.
  The main difference compared to `tag` operation is that the tag values in `dynTag` can be other nodes, which are computed with `Tcur` tag.
  When both `dynTag` and `tag` are applicable, prefer `tag` for performance reason.
- `read(tag, accu)` performs a gather with tag `Tcur/tag`, then combine the results using `accu`mulator the accumulators include `sum/prod/min/max`, corresponding to the arithmetic operations.
  Accumulator may be `undefined`, in which case, the gathering is assumed to contain exactly one entry.

## <a name="customize"></a> Calculator Customization

`Calculator` can be customized via subclassing.
Functions that are designed to be overriden by such subclasses include

```
- computeMeta(n: AnyNode, value: number | string,
    x: (CalcResult<number | string, M> | undefined)[],
    br: CalcResult<number | string, M>[],
    tag: Tag | undefined): M
- computeCustom(args: (number | string)[], op: string): any
```
