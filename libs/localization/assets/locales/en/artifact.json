However, most of the artifacts are not this lucky. The <3>Current RV</3> of an artifact is a percentage over that max value artifact. The <5>Maximum RV</5> is the maximum possible RV an artifact can achieve, if the remaining artifact rolls from upgrades are the hightest possible value.</5><6>Excluding an artifact</6><7>By Excluding an artifact <1></1>, This artifact will not be picked up by the build generator for optimization.

You can scan in your artifacts with screenshots! On the Artifact Editor, click the <1>Show Me How!</1> button to learn more.</3><4>Automatic Artifact Scanner</4><5>If you are playing Genshin on PC, you can download a tool that automatically scans all of your artifacts for you, and you can then import that data in <1></1> Settings. <3>Click here</3> for a list of scanners that are compatible with GO.</5><6>Duplicate/Upgrade artifact detection</6><7>Did you know GO can detect if you are adding a <1>duplicate</1> artifact that exists in the system? It can also detect if the current artifact in editor is an <3>upgrade</3> of an existing artifact as well. Once a duplicate/upgrade is detected, a preview will allow you to compare the two artifacts in question(See Image).</7>",
