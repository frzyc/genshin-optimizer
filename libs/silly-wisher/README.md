# silly-wisher

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

This is a library for the Silly Wisher Assets used by Genshin Optimizer, with their permission to use for the April fools event.

## Updating the splash and portrait art

You can extract the assets from the Silly Wisher APK. I used
[AssetRipper](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper) for this. Make sure
to run the extractor on the entire contents of the APK, not just the
`data.unity3d` file.
