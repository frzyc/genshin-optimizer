    "desc": "People in the Outer Ring once called him the \"Overlord Pompey\" with true respect.\nBut now, his soul has been corrupted by potent Ether, his body polluted by sulfur and crude oil; the heart that once beat solely to protect the Outer Ring has turned into a supercritical Ether core filled with infinite power.\nThe former \"Lord of the Outer Ring\" has been reborn in flames, taking on a different form.\nFreedom, majesty... Violence, insanity.\nIt charges through the dust and flames, seizing anything that moves and then mercilessly tearing and shattering it.\nThose familiar with it before have guessed from its fractured whispers that what drives it is not a desire for petty revenge, but rather a desire to crush all outliers who dare to challenge the laws of the Outer Ring.\nMaybe it's the last vestige of the former Overlord Pompey's lingering will.\n\"Our leader has turned into that thing, but... he still feels like the same person.\"",
