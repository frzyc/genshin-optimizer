After briefly studying its behavioral pattern of spewing liquid Ether, the Association classified Alpeca as a low-threat Ethereal and ended its investigation.\nScholars once showed great interest in observing how Alpeca spews liquefied Ether and even commissioned surveys for closer observation.\nExperienced investigators have been avoiding such tasks for unknown reasons, however.\n\"Run!
