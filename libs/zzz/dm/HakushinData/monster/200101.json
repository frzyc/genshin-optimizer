  "Desc": "Based on their research, the Hollow Investigative Association speculates the Tarasque Mixer contains various levels of liquefied Ether.\nWhen it stirs and mixes its stored Ether, a complex reaction takes place, resulting in the release of destructive and violent energy. The power unleashed is comparable to that of the heavy artillery employed by the Defense Force.\nExperienced investigators understand the importance of maintaining a low profile to avoid direct bombardment from its heavy artillery.\n\"When it leaned down towards me, I thought it was some kind of strange welcoming gift. But when its cannon chamber lit up, I realized... it was a farewell gift.\"",
