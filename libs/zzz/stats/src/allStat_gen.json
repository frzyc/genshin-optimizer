              "Lighter automatically gains <color=#FFFFFF>Morale</color> over time, at a rate of 2.9 points per second.

When <color=#FFFFFF>Morale</color> reaches 80, the next time Lighter switches into battle he immediately launches a <color=#FFFFFF>Quick Assist</color>. Once <color=#FFFFFF>Morale</color> is 80 or higher, executing the 5th hit of his <color=#FFFFFF>Basic Attack</color> puts Lighter in the <color=#FFFFFF>Morale Burst</color> state, enhancing the power of the startup light punch, jab combo, and the Finishing Move of the 5th hit of his <color=#FFFFFF>Basic Attack</color>. When a skill hits an enemy with its power increased, it will continuously consume <color=#FFFFFF>Morale</color>. With every 10 points of <color=#FFFFFF>Morale</color> consumed, Lighter's Impact increases by <color=#2BAD00>1%</color>, up to a maximum increase of <color=#2BAD00>10%</color>, and lasting 6s.\nIn the <color=#FFFFFF>Morale Burst</color> state, Lighter will no longer automatically gain <color=#FFFFFF>Morale</color> over time. If his <color=#FFFFFF>Morale</color> is exhausted during a startup light punch or jab combo, he will automatically follow up with a more powerful Finishing Move.\nIn the <color=#FFFFFF>Morale Burst</color> state, when startup light punches or jab combos hit enemies, the target's <color=#98EFF0>Ice RES</color> and <color=#FF5521>Fire RES</color> are reduced by 15%, lasting 30s.\nIn the <color=#FFFFFF>Morale Burst</color> state, when the Finishing Move hits an enemy, it applies the <color=#FFFFFF>Collapse</color> effect on the target, extending its Stunned duration by 3s. The <color=#FFFFFF>Collapse</color> effect can trigger only once on the same target before they recover from Stun.\nWhen the Finishing Move of the 5th hit of his <color=#FFFFFF>Basic Attack</color> hits an enemy, when he switches off field, or when his <color=#FFFFFF>Morale</color> runs out, Lighter will leave the <color=#FFFFFF>Morale Burst</color> state, keeping any unspent <color=#FFFFFF>Morale</color>.",
