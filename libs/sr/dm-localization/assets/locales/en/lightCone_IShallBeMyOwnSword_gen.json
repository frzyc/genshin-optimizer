    "description": "Increases the wearer's CRIT DMG by <color=#f29e38ff><unbreak>#1[i]%</unbreak></color>. When an ally (excluding the wearer) gets attacked or loses HP, the wearer gains 1 stack of Eclipse, up to a max of <unbreak>#2[i]</unbreak> stack(s). Each stack of Eclipse increases the DMG of the wearer's next attack by <color=#f29e38ff><unbreak>#3[f1]%</unbreak></color>. When <unbreak>#2[i]</unbreak> stack(s) are reached, additionally enables that attack to ignore <color=#f29e38ff><unbreak>#4[i]%</unbreak></color> of the enemy's DEF. This effect will be removed after the wearer uses an attack."
