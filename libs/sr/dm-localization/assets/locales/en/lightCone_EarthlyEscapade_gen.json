At the start of the battle, the wearer gains Mask, lasting for <unbreak>#6[i]</unbreak> turn(s). While the wearer has Mask, the wearer's allies have their CRIT Rate increased by <color=#f29e38ff><unbreak>#5[i]%</unbreak></color> and their CRIT DMG increased by <color=#f29e38ff><unbreak>#2[i]%</unbreak></color>. For every 1 Skill Point the wearer recovers (including Skill Points that exceed the limit), they gain 1 stack of Radiant Flame. And when the wearer has <unbreak>#4[i]</unbreak> stacks of Radiant Flame, all the stacks are removed, and they gain Mask, lasting for <unbreak>#3[i]</unbreak> turn(s)."
