When the wearer deals DMG to an enemy inflicted with Wind Shear, Burn, Shock, or Bleed, each respectively grants 1 stack of Prophet, stacking up to <unbreak>#4[i]</unbreak> time(s). In a single battle, only 1 stack of Prophet can be granted for each type of DoT. Every stack of Prophet increases wearer's ATK by <color=#f29e38ff><unbreak>#2[i]%</unbreak></color> and enables the DoT dealt to ignore <color=#f29e38ff><unbreak>#3[f1]%</unbreak></color> of the target's DEF."
